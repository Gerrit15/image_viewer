# current goals
- nice enough looking ui
- multiple sorting options
    - date modified?  might be annoying
- multithreaded buffering (really only if its needed)
- wraparound buffering? dunno if it's properly in there
- size maximums, dynamic?
- sort into individual files
- zooming?
- name updates with name of file
- clap

# stretch goals
- handling images without proper suffixes? Through load errors?
- config file
- handle ALL errors
- open on a single image
- handle opening with no images
- get images from image crate so it loads more?

- pdf loader??
    - this might be a fully seperate project
